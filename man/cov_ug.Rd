undirected graph.

\details{
Function \code{\link[=port]{port()}} uses the method described in
Córdoba et al. (2018). In summary, it consists on generating a random
matrix \code{Q} and performing row-wise orthogonalization such that if \code{i} and \code{j}
are not adjacent in \code{ug}, then the rows corresponding to such indices are
orthogonalized, without violating previous orthogonalizations and without
introducing unwanted independences. The resulting matrix after the process
has finished is the cross product of \code{Q}.

We also provide an implementation of the most commonly used in the
literature \code{\link[=diagdom]{diagdom()}}. By contrast, this method produces a random matrix \code{M}
with zeros corresponding to missing edges in \code{ug}, and then enforces a
dominant diagonal to ensure positive definiteness. Matrices produced by
\code{diagdom} usually are better conditioned than those by \code{port}; however, they
typically suffer from small off-diagonal entries, which can compromise model
validation in Gaussian graphical models. This is avoided by \code{port}.

\examples{
## Partial orthogonalization
# Generate a full matrix (default behaviour)
port()
 
# Generate a matrix with a percentage of zeros
port(d = 0.5)
port(d = 0.5, zapzeros = FALSE) # no zero zap

# Generate a random undirected graph structure
ug <- rgraph(p = 3, d = 0.5)
igraph::print.igraph(ug)

# Generate a matrix complying with the predefined zero pattern
port(ug = ug)
port(ug = ug, zapzeros = FALSE) # no zero zap

## Diagonal dominance 
# Generate a full matrix (default behaviour)
diagdom()
 
# Generate a matrix with a percentage of zeros
diagdom(d = 0.5)

# Generate a matrix complying with the predefined zero pattern
igraph::print.igraph(ug)
diagdom(ug = ug)
