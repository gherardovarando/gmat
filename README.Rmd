# gmat
An R package for simulating positive definite matrices constrained by acyclic
directed and undirected graphs.

## Installation

The package is available on `CRAN`, to get the latest stable version use:
```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("gmat")
```
The current version on `CRAN` only includes the methods for undirected graph
models.

Alternatively, using the R package `devtools` one may install the development version:
```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("irenecrsn/gmat")
```

The only R package required for `gmat` is `igraph`, which can also be installed
from CRAN.

## An example of use 

First, we generate a random graph with `3` nodes and density `0.25`, using the
`igraph` package. Then we generate, using our `gmat::port` function, `3` matrices
consistent with such random graphical structure.


```{r example}
ug <- igraph::sample_gnp(n = 3, p = 0.25)
matrices <- gmat::port(N = 3, ug = ug)
matrices
```

We apprieciate how the zero pattern is shared by all of the
simulated matrices. The return value is an array, and so the individual matrices
can be accessed as `matrices[, , n]`, where `n` is the index of the matrix we
want to retrieve from the sample, ranging from `1` to `N`.
