This package implements the methods described in the
[paper](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v72/cordoba18a.html):

> Córdoba, I., Varando, G., Bielza, C. and Larrañaga, P.
A partial orthogonalization method for simulating covariance and concentration
graph matrices, Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PGM 2018), vol. 72,
pp. 61 - 72, 2018.

It is governed by two main functions, `port` and `diagdom`, which take as input an undirected
graph structure `ug` and a sample size `N`, and generates `N`
covariance/concentration matrices subject to the zeros imposed by the undirected
graph structure `ug`.

The sample is generated by `port` with the method described in the above
paper. The classical diagonal dominance
method is the one used by function `diagdom`.

## Installation

Using the R package `devtools` one may install the development version from this
branch:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("irenecrsn/gmat", ref = "port-upd")
```

The only R package required for `gmat` is `igraph`, which can be installed
from CRAN.

## An example of use 

First, we generate a random graph with `3` nodes and density `0.25`, using the
`igraph` package. Then we generate, using our `gmat::port` function, `3` matrices
consistent with such random graphical structure.


```{r example}
ug <- igraph::sample_gnp(n = 3, p = 0.25)
matrices <- gmat::port(N = 3, ug = ug)
matrices
```

We apprieciate how the zero pattern is shared by all of the
simulated matrices. The return value is an array, and so the individual matrices
can be accessed as `matrices[, , n]`, where `n` is the index of the matrix we
want to retrieve from the sample, ranging from `1` to `N`.
